BrainDump Pitch

PART 1 – Key value, usage, and target,

Hello! We are the BrainDump team.

We go around with so many thoughts in our minds. We have to do’s,
responsibilities, worries, and cool new ideas!

Once in a while we need a break!

Introducing: BrainDump! An app that allows you to empty your mind and
provides some much needed levity when you have too much or hard stuff
going on.

As you go about your day, you can choose to reach for your mobile and
pause to dump all your thoughts into a simple text field.

You can also refer back to your entries at a later time to read, edit,
or delete them.

What happens next is our secret sauce! Our engine, we like to call it
the ‘Shrink Bot’.

The app analyses your words for recurring themes and offers relevant
tags you can use to search for inspirational or funny bits of content
that will help relax you and gain some perspective on whatever is
occupying your mind.

You get to browse
- Quotes
- poems
- jokes
- songs
- videos
- Etc.

Let’s demo!
