He never calls me during the work day, and I wouldn't answer anyway.

But he does and I do only it's not him on the other end. It's a co-worker. Matt? Mark? Aaron just had a seizure at work and Matt or Mark wants to know if this has happened before. I want to know if he's joking, I want him to be joking, insist that he's joking and even after I've heard him tell the EMT next to him that Aaron has never had a seizure before and has no medical conditions that I'm aware of, even after I've stood up stunned at my desk and asked my boss where an ambulance should take my boyfriend if he's had a seizure, even after Matt or Mark has relayed that information to the EMT and told me that he'll call again as soon as Aaron is in the ambulance, I call their receptionist to make sure it's not all a hoax.

It's not, of course, and moments later my boss is striding back into the photo studio with my mother behind her. 'Grab your coat,' my mom says, 'we're going to the hospital.'

It's a quiet ride to South Minneapolis. I'm not sure what I should be doing, but I call his flight attendant mother and leave what I'm sure is the most poorly executed voicemail in the history of the world. I call his sister and offer up another message, slightly improved in delivery, asking her to work their family phone tree. There, I did something.

My mother is excellent in times of tragedy. She doesn't believe in hysteria, and as my body warms up and I start to breathe a little heavier she stops me short of choking on my own sobs as we pull up in front of the dark doors of the Emergency Room.

"Go in there and be a woman," she says. And even though I'm not sure quite how to do that, I open the car door and go.
